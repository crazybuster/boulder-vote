goals of clean energy and energy efficiency. I have championed smaller dwellings, in-fill, and creative ideas to to
address climate change through the building envelope, energy efficiency, and transportation.

My biggest environmental achievement is co-founding a company that makes tiny homes and structures from upcycled
shipping containers. Investing my own money and time, I have demonstrated my commitment to the
environment by a) recycling shipping containers that otherwise would become nature’s waste or melted down b)
building small c) building energy efficient structures. We have designed and received approval from the U.S. Forest
Service for a bike hut to be used in on a bike trail in Utah.

On a smaller scale, I have a very small, but important role as a volunteer OSMP Raptor Monitor. I help to monitor
peregrine falcons on a closure area south of Boulder. It’s the most rewarding thing I do.`

Second, I think it’s important to partner with CU more effectively to reduce waste. Students represent 30,000 residents of our community who are trying to get an education, and while surveying indicates we have a very environmentally considerate student body, the reality of each spring cleanout shows that there is room to improve. Establishing drop off sites throughout the city for hard to recycle items two times a year is a great way for both students and the whole community to get rid of items in an environmentally conscious way.

paramount importance for the City of Boulder, Colorado, the U.S., and the world. I have supported the goals of
renewable energy and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, and I have supported the goals of the muni project.
However, I am a realist and have not been satisfied with our progress. We have been slowed to a crawl from legal
and regulatory challenges, and in the meantime, we are not progressing toward a more energy-efficient future. I
support the community being able to vote on the three ballot measures, so we can see if they still support
spending the kind of money we need to spend to continue this effort. I will be closely watching the PUC decision in
September to see how difficult and time-consuming the effort will continue to be.

We’ve spent 7+ years and close to $20M, and we’re asking the voters for another $16.5M to get to a “go/no-go”
decision. Will other cities actually be able to model what we’ve done? I question if the solution to clean energy for
the country will be accomplished by each city municipalizing. If we get a discouraging decision from the PUC or if
the voters decide not to support the utility occupation tax, I would encourage the City of Boulder to work with
Denver, Aurora, and other cities in Colorado on a common solution that could have a greater impact on climate
change. Options could be to pressure Xcel to switch to clean energy much faster or to lobby the state legislature to
abandon the electric monopoly. States much more conservative than ours now have choice of their electric

some of Boulder’s rare plants and animals. When land or species are endangered or need protection, we should
designate it as such. In addition, I support temporary closings to support species during mating season.
I believe strongly that when we get people out in nature, using it, they fall in love with it. Then they become
stewards of the land and the species on that land. Obviously, we must have strong policies and education about
how to treat the resources, but it’s better to get people on board through their use and involvement. The City of
Boulder OSMP Volunteer organization and rangers are best-in-class, and their programs teach appreciation.
When we acquire land that has been operating as ranchland, we should look proactively at encouraging
recreational use. In addition, we should use it to encourage kids (and adults) to understand where their food
comes from and the tie-in to environmentally-friendly agriculture.`

Other examples include trails designated for off-road biking on some days, and designated for walkers on other days.   There are some limits which must be absolute if our Open Space is to succeed with its objectives dealing with maintenance of wildlife and conservation values.

The City has built an extensive network of east-west bike paths, based on our creeks and flood control areas. While

and commuting. However, we need to create more north/south bicycle routes to connect to make commuting by
bike a more viable option. Bike lanes on busy roads like Folsom are not an option for families with kids.

We need to make sure drivers obey speed limits and crosswalk crossings, and we should evaluate intersections for
safety in left hand turn lanes (delayed lights). We need to make sure our streets are free of potholes and
obstructions that cause bike injuries. I also think we should consider a small bicycle license fee and some

was also very impressed with the feedback from the County Commissioners. They are right, that housing is a huge
need for this community and for their staff and students, and that should be the priority for CU on this property.
The first priority for the City is flood control for the downstream residents, so we must work cooperatively with CU
to get the best flood mitigation plan possible. We should work closely with CU to develop ideas for preservation of
wetlands and open space, and I believe CU is eager to work with us and want to involve citizens. Building densely
and environmentally friendly will be critical to the environment. Finally, the transportation plan will be important,
and I would want to see bike paths to campus, electric buses, and encouragement to be car-free, if possible. In
fact, I have encouraged CU to be car-free as a campus. `

· Maximizing the open space for future residents of CU South and current residents of nearby neighborhoods. Ensuring neighborhood trail connections and trail connections to other southern OSMP properties.
· Using the open space as the primary flood mitigation area.
· Working with CU to slow or eliminate the growth in enrollment unless it is tied to
additional housing options for students.
· Maximizing commuting options to campus and the rest of Boulder that do not involve
cars. This could be the best example of what an almost car-less village could look like.`

Building on a floodplain requires an extreme dedication to studying and planning before anything is built. As a member of the community who lives in a garden level condo that flooded in 2013 I’m aware of the toll such events take on our community. Aside from proper flood planning we need to take proper steps to keep as much of the natural environment in this unique part of our city untouched. Maximizing porous surfaces and keeping as much of the natural vegetation as possible will both reduce flood potential and the impact on nature.`

          "answer": `•	A much more complete survey of onsite endangered /threatened species should be done, similar to what the Fish and Wildlife Department would do.  Why – because nothing of that magnitude has been done.  Without it, it’s impossible to know what will be lost or endangered by development.  The area is part of Colorado’s single largest stand of mesic tall grass prairie, and is home to many endangered/threatened species that Biohabitat’s quick survey did not assess.
•	Any annexation should recognize that this portion of the South Boulder Creek ecosystem is extremely important for habitat, flood plain preservation and flood control. Why – the Boulder Valley Comprehensive Plan contains guiding principles that address areas of preservation and restoration of flood plains, including the 500-year flood plain. Removal of the existing levy is key to restoration of the area, as the plan outlines.
•	Complete assessment of surface- and groundwater, and aquifer must be done, because it hasn’t been done. Why – because without it, construction impacts are unknown.  100,000 feet3 of concrete foundations displace 100,000 feet3 of water, which must go somewhere. Tantra Park, Fraser Meadows and Hogan Pancost share this same very high aquifer and may be impacted.

And, we need to make sure that there is appropriate consideration of any development on that property for groundwater and other unique environmental features.

          "answer": `addressed either before, or as a condition of annexation.  These include road and traffic connections, the flood control and management considerations both for the CU South property and the downstream areas which could be affected, the manner in which undeveloped CU South areas will be managed, conditions of public access to the area, the types of development (e.g. residential, office, teaching facilities, laboratory, sports, support facilities, etc.) and the size/design characteristics.

          I understand the City will be carrying out a review by consultants of its decision to move ahead with the “Option D” proposal for flood mitigation and protection.  I believe that a competent, comprehensive and objective review will recommend major changes to the “Option D” proposal, and that it would therefore be premature to enter into any annexation-related negotiations until completion of that review.

          I would seek to ensure that, as has already been identified by the Planning Board and the City Council, that building be kept out of the 500-year flood plain, that residential development be focused on affordable housing, that public access to the area and its public open space surroundings be guaranteed, that as much area as possible remain naturally vegetated and undeveloped. `
