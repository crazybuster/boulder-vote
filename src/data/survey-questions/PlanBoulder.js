I understand those challenges, having lived in affordable housing myself.  Yet I believe we can create affordability, without universal high density and runaway growth.

I straddle many worlds that don’t often intersect in Boulder. This puts me in an excellent position to facilitate the elusive solutions our community really needs now.

I believe in preserving neighborhood character in Boulder – whether neighborhoods are single family, multi-unit, condos, townhomes, apartments, or rural.

I support area plans, sub-community plans, and neighborhood plans to address specific areas’ needs and issues.  Neighborhood plans, written by neighborhood residents working with city planners, typically address neighborhood history, neighborhood unique character, census information, housing characteristics, community facilities, resources, and organizations, assets; neighborhood deficiencies/challenges, traffic and transportation issues, including alternative transportation opportunities (biking and walking routes); parking, parks and open space, schools, diversity, safety, and access to commercial and public services.

Neighborhood plans (such as Denver’s and Madison, Wisconsin’s) allow major input from the neighborhood residents who best know their neighborhoods.  I view neighborhood residents as a real resource.  It’s virtually impossible to match their level of on-the-ground knowledge of their neighborhoods. `

I note that the sub-community plan for North Boulder, where I live, is an excellent model for the benefits of sub-community planning. We must ensure, though, that sub-community planning does not become a proxy for stopping all redevelopment across the community. For that reason, the City of Boulder should still review individual redevelopment proposals in the absence of sub-community plans and assess them on their own merits. We also must make sure that sub-community plans reflect both local neighborhood interests and community-wide goals. This will entail engaging a wide diversity of neighborhood and community interests in the sub-community planning process.

It need not be this way.  A place like Boulder, CO ought to be able to do better.  And it can – by listening to residents.

I believe that City Council members serve the people of Boulder.  So why would they not want to start all decision processes, by listening to residents, and including them early on, rather than after plans are fully baked?

been sceptical that we can meet the legal and regulatory challenges within a reasonable budget

community passes the Utility Occupation Tax, we will spend another $16.5 M just to get us to a
“go or no-go” decision, likely in 2020. This will put our financial reserves at risk, due to spending
the money before the Utility Occupation Tax revenue comes in. If we win our legal and
regulatory battle, we will then need to invest +$250M to separate, condemn Xcel assets, and
pay for stranded costs. It costs too much, with too much risk, and it doesn’t guarantee we’ll get
any further than Xcel will in the same timeframe. In fact, we may reach our goals later than
they will.

Last week, Xcel made their own announcement about reaching 55% renewables by 2026 by
retiring two coal plants and reducing carbon emissions by 60 percent from 2005 levels, all while
lowering costs to customers. This announcement proves that market forces as well as our
pressure and pressure from other cities is impacting Xcel’s strategy. That, with the verbal
reading we got from the PUC is the final indicator to me that we should go in a different
direction.

What would I do?

1) Partner with Denver, the State, and Xcel to work together to attain our
targets, which will do more to further climate goals at the state level. We should involve Rocky
Mountain Institute, Conservation Colorado, Western Resource, and Sierra Club as well.

2) Work
on our transportation sector, especially with Electric Vehicles 3) Use some of the money we
save from not continuing down the muni path to create a solar farm 4) Look at land use and
zoning to support more environmentally friendly building, and look at increasing environmental
building codes. `

While I strongly support Boulder’s 100% renewable power goal, and I have supported muni in the past, I no longer believe that we should continue to pursue muni given the persistent questions about affordability, effectiveness, and timing.

“best” rooftops (as shown in the city’s aerial analysis), ramping up hydro generation,
getting state legislation to allow us to use “competitive pricing” for selecting our power
sources and to pass other measures that will change the rules regarding power
generation and sharing (like microgrids). Also, how about getting IBM and other hightech

of our land use is zoned for single family homes, the most inefficient use of land, economically
and environmentally. Because land is increasing in value, all homes, especially detached homes
for sale, are increasing. A lot.

In addition, we have created such an arduous and expensive process for getting approvals for
housing, it adds significantly to the cost. This includes heavy fees in building affordable housing,
even for our own Housing Authority and other non-profit and for-profit affordable housing
builders.

I support using public funds to buy buildings and land, zoning for more effective land use
(perhaps more mixed-use), more dense in-fill, especially in transit corridors, and light in-fill with
creative solutions in neighborhoods (ADU’s, allowance for split lots, duplexes on corners, etc.)
In addition, I support waiving some fees for our affordable housing developers and fast-tracking
of the approval process for affordable housing. I highly encourage us to work with Boulder

transportation in with our land use planning. I applaud many of the ideas from the Back Porch

I want Council to actively explore options, in addition to our current strides in housing for our lowest income earners, to address the shortage in market-rate middle income housing so that more young professionals and families can afford to live here.

Boulder can more successfully create mixed-use neighborhoods that offer convenient and affordable access to restaurants and bars, transportation, shopping, and other amenities. As a resident in the Uptown Broadway neighborhood, I believe these 15-minute-type neighborhoods offer viable solutions to Boulder’s needs around housing, reducing traffic congestion, and building community.

As Boulder’s economy continues to grow and attract more businesses and better paying jobs, it will become increasingly important to offset rising home prices with a diversity of housing options that ensure that residents are not squeezed or pushed outside of Boulder for housing needs, which will only compound our traffic headaches. Working with neighborhood groups, we need to identify areas in our community that will accommodate new and affordable housing, including some of our commercial and industrial-zoned lands.

new unit in Boulder (according to the Keyser Marston’s 2016 report) is of concern to
me, and an issue that the Council must address. At least 50% of new housing should be
permanently affordable to maintain economic diversity in our community. This can be
addressed in three ways:

* Tuesday night, the Council started the process of ratcheting up the Affordable Housing
requirement from 20 to 25%. I support that move and also the changes that provide
developers with incentives to build affordable housing on-site and to include housing for
middle-income residents.

* New commercial/industrial developments should be responsible for providing funds to
house their employees who are paid salaries at and below AMI. Keyser Marston’s
linkage fee recommendation was set at a level that would require linkage fees to
accomplish that. Because I believe that people need to be held responsible for costs
they impose on our community, I support a fee higher than the one Council passed in
the last year.

* The City needs to come up with a plan to maintain current housing that’s affordable to
low and middle-income residents. This will not be easy, but if the solution agreed to by
Council requires new revenues, we should look for innovative ways to fund it or if
necessary put it to a vote of the people.

* Other options worth exploring include: putting conditions on annexations to require
affordable housing, using deed-restrictions, and creating land trusts on city-owned land`

increased the fees from $9.53 to $12, and the fees have only been in place for a couple years,
so we don’t know the impact of the fees. Developers (or landlords) will increase the rents (or
purchase price of the property) to accommodate the linkage fees.(Despite what some people
think, developers will NOT take it in the shorts….they will just build this into the proforma). The
businesses who lease the property will need to increase their prices to accommodate the rent,
so they won’t have the money to pay their employees more (which is what we really need).
Rents all over the rest of the city will also increase accordingly (market prices will be set by the
new building). All other businesses will have to increase their prices to cover their rents, and if
they can’t, they will have to move out of the city or go out of business. It’s likely higher costs
can be absorbed by large companies and chain retailers who can average costs across the
country, but it will be less easily absorbed by local small businesses. We are already hearing
about small businesses in Boulder who are suffering due to the cost of rent. Net/net, the cost of
$12 will already drive up the costs for small business and non-profits. It will drive up cost of
living, which our lower and middle income residents do not need. I do not support raising the
impact fee more than the amount we just increased it (which was a 26% increase. How many of
us got a 26% raise last year?).`

Historically, it is residential development that fails to cover the costs of the city services required to support it. Retail sales generated from commercial development, and the multiplier effect, make up the difference, which explains why western civilization has not gone bankrupt.

The $12 fee was chosen responsibly and will prime a pump that combines cash-in-lieu fees with non-profit, state and federal funding to build more affordable low- and middle-income housing than the private sector can build without such subsidies. If the $12 fee proves insufficient, I would be willing to revisit the calculation in the future. Development excise fees must be roughly proportional to demonstrable impacts, and must be earmarked, spent and accounted for to meet statutory and constitutional requirements.

From a logical and conceptual standpoint, I’m not sure that I agree with the calculus of the $50.50 figure.  We’re trying to partially increase the percentage of workers currently housed in Boulder, in order to decrease the number of in-commuters.  If this is the case, then  we may want to re-think this calculation that’s just based on simply maintaining our current 39% of our workforce that’s housed in Boulder.

I do not support any caps or restrictions on the number of people, although I believe we have an obligation to have open conversations about usage levels and appropriate levels of maintenance. One of the greatest threats to our Open Space is the failure to provide sufficient maintenance resources. To the extent that we fail to maintain trails and proper access facilities, we risk increased damage to our lands as people and animals move off-trail.

As I have learned through my own experiences with Open Space, I believe that facilitating responsible usage encourages greater preservation, and that we have an obligation as a community to discuss usage levels and appropriate levels of maintenance. As pressures from outside visitors grow, I believe we must take into account mass transportation and parking policies that support our goals for Open Space, as we did for Chautauqua and the pilot program to provide free busing.

service is just not adequate to get people where they need to go in a reasonable timeframe. I
ride the bus a lot, and it takes 45 minutes on the bus (with walk time) vs. 10 minutes in the car
and 15 minutes on a bike. Electric bikes, Uber, and other transportation options should be
considered as well as an Eco Pass. We should look at the travel times, pros and cons, and cost
of each methodology.

For years, the City’s plan to reduce GHG emissions from transportation has depended on efforts
to move people out of single-occupancy vehicles into shared vehicles and buses, bicycles, and
foot travel. It is increasingly being predicted that surface transportation will soon be dominated
by self-driving, electric-powered vehicles owned by large organizations and rented to users on a
ride-by-ride basis. Do you think this prediction will be fulfilled in the next 20 years? If yes, how

I don’t know what will happen, but it will be dramatically different in 10 years much less 20. The
“sharing” economy is growing dramatically. I just sold my car and would prefer not buying
another one if I can get by without it. Many people already use Uber and Lyft, and I see a
movement of older women getting on electric bikes (myself included). What should we do?
First, get behind electric vehicles and bikes in a big way: hiring a dedicated person, converting
the city fleet, evangelize the companies to put in charging stations, convert our buses to EV’s,

The City should stay in front of this coming disruption by 1) testing out new mobility approaches today to learn and prepare for the future, 2) develop policies that mitigate against the uncertainty of exactly when this will happen, but leverage the certainty that it will happen (i.e. don't invest in parking that has a 30-year pay back horizon) and 3) create a policy/regulatory environment to encourage desired outcomes (i.e. shared and electric instead of individually-owned and gas-powered.)

          "answer": `Yes. TDM should extend over the entire life of the development because this program
has to do with saving energy, reducing poor air quality and peak-period congestion.
Since Boulder has experienced expanded Peak congestion times, it’s more important
than ever to continue TDM. We need to measure traffic volumes at more times of the
day and evening hours and use that information to assess how much we need to ratchet
up TDM actions. New applications are being developed to reduce peak congestion and
the City should be exploring how it can apply these locally. `

          "answer": `Mandatory TDM is intended to be a catalyst for change in the personal habits of people who may benefit from use of alternative modes of travel. Absent the TDM incentives, habits may not be developed due to barriers to entry. Requiring a developer to cover the projected future cost of TDM subsidies in perpetuity is unrealistic and, probably, unconstitutional. As noted above, any such exaction must be roughly proportional to the impacts sought to be mitigated. After a reasonable period of time, the impacts from any particular development blend with others, and become indistinguishable, from an economic and legal perspective. Without a defined term, it is impossible for a developer to build the cost into a project. The higher the project costs become, the less affordable it will be. A balancing of the public benefit and private burden must occur, and that balance must be reasonable.`

          "answer": `I do think that TDM should be required to extend over the entire life of a development, for a couple reasons:
•	First, there are traffic implications from the development throughout its entire life.  So it’s not clear why the development would only have to implement TDM for a limited period of its life.
•	Second, it’s even more critical than that, because difficulties and costs associated with mitigating traffic become many times greater for a city, as it reaches build-out and its transportation infrastructure is maxed out.  In other words, transportation management costs for a city do not follow a linear pattern.  These costs become exponentially greater as the transportation infrastructure gets maxed out and cities have to resort to increasingly exotic, aggressive, and costly strategies to maintain current levels of service on their roadways.

As the previous question indicates, out transportation systems are rapidly evolving because of disruptive thinking on our transportation systems, in part because of ride-share programs like Uber and Lyft, self-driving cars, and the rise of electric vehicles.
